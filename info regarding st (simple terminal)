Hi, due to more customisability being with the version directly from suckless,
please install the latest of ST by either visiting st on suckless.org or by following this link - https://st.suckless.org/

More information I wanted to squeeze in here...

Regularly I find cd'ing into the st folder and sudo make installing repetitive. 
So to alleviate this, I wrote a script that does it for me. Haven't mapped it to anything YET but it's fewer clicks compared to:
cd st-0.8.2
sudo make install.

A simple script in ~ called st.sh

./st.sh

I could simplify it further by just called it st and it would be ./st but meh.

Future improvements mapping st update script to a keypress and more patches that improve st functionality :)

Regards,

En
